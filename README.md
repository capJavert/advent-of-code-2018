# Advent of Code 2018

### Update #1: It's that time of the year again.. So let's go!!
### Update #2: 5 days done, day 3 was definitely hardest yet.. but getting to now collision/overlap algorithms and methods was cool!
### Update #3: My brain didn't really work very good... just like those workers from day 7 puzzle :expressionless:
### Update #4: 11th day done, part 2 solution took ~40sec to execute, well better ever than never... :grin:
### Update #5: Note to myself for day 12.. yout don't just read the input.. one must also understand it...
### Update #6: Stuck (suck) at day 15, really close but just can't get it right.. solved day 16 though.. ðŸ˜£
### Update #7: Day 15 done!!! Back on track! Really hope this last week is going to be a little easier...
### Update #8: Nope.. this week is even harder... this year puzzles really have some complex problems, its starting to take too much time per day.. finished day 18 though... barely... ohhh
